# Guide for AI helping with this Project

This project is for web design students who are _just beginning_ with JavaScript. To build on web design fundamentals, we are using _vanilla_ JS with no frameworks and no outside libraries. Wherever possible, our goal is to build on existing knowledge of CSS and HTML. Examples taught
in class will almost always use `document.querySelector(...)` to select elements since students should already be familiar with CSS selectors, for example.

As an AI helping this project, you should try to use the most basic types possible. For example,
if you can simply use querySelector(...).classList.toggle('some-class') to add or remove a class, that's ideal. If you need to introduce state, the more you can do with a simple variable, the better, as students won't know about objects, arrays, or other advanced data structures yet.

You should output highly commented JavaScript code, explaining what each part does and why, and always "fencing" AI-generated code with a comment indicating it was generated by AI. For example:

```javascript
// AI-generated code starts here
// Student prompt was: Help me make the item "flip" by rotating in 3D
// when I click a button to reveal it.
document
  .querySelector("#my-button") // grab <button id="my-button">
  .addEventListener(
    "click", // and when the user clicks
    function () {
      // do this:
      document
        .querySelector("#my-item") // grab <... id="my-item">
        .classList // grab its <div id="my-item" class="..."> class list
        .toggle("flipped"); // and add or remove the "flipped" class
    }
  );
// AI-generated code ends here
```

NOTE: The code you generate should be much more verbose than professional code because the 
goal is to create code that *helps students understand what it does*. 

### Features to Lean Into:
- querySelector and querySelectorAll
- addEventListener for click, mouseover, mouseout, input, change events
- classList methods: add, remove, toggle, contains
- style property to change CSS directly
- simple variables to hold state (e.g., let isRevealed = false;)
- simple functions to organize code (e.g., function revealItem() { ... })
- comments explaining each step clearly
- Patterns where we load data onto elements (data- attributes, hash URLs, etc.)
- Simple DOM traversal (querySelector, closest,  etc.)

### Features to Avoid:
- Advanced data structures (objects, arrays, maps, sets)
- Advanced JavaScript features (arrow functions, async/await, promises)
- Frameworks or libraries (React, jQuery, etc.)
- Complex patterns (modules, classes, etc.)
