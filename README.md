## Task

Create an interactive, single-page website that teaches the user something through design and interactivity. You’ll build a small “explainer” experience where users choose reasons, explore states, or navigate through a concept — and the page responds with movement, reveals, and visual changes.

Think of it as a mix of:

- an infographic
- a guided decision tree
- a playful interface demo
- a tiny storytelling experience

Your teacher’s demo will be a site called “Should I Ride?”, but your topic will be completely your own.

## Why This Project?

Modern web design is rarely static. Designers build experiences where visuals change, cards reveal information, and users “poke” the interface to learn more. Even simple JavaScript can transform layout into behavior.

This project helps you explore:

- how to present information visually
- how to guide users through a story or decision
- how interactivity can clarify (or complicate!) a design
- how user actions change what they see

No frameworks. No libraries. Just HTML, CSS, and a bit of vanilla JavaScript.

## A Note on AI

Generative AI tools can help you enormously on this project, and I recommend you use them wisely. Copilot is built into your Codespace editor and can be very helpful.
Note: If you use the AI within Codespaces, I have provided a guide to it under ~/.github/copilot-instructions.md If you want to use another AI to help, I recommend including the prompt
I provide under AI.md as a prompt to help it help you.

When using AI, you should do your best to make sure you understand the concept of what it is doing.

For this project, you may be on the verge of "vibe coding," where people with no coding experience can generate code that works. In this case, your goal is to make sure you _can_ understand what the code generated does and that you can explain it in your write-up, even if you didn't write it yourself. For that reason, I recommend you use AI to generate relatively small pieces of code at a time and that you test and understand each piece one at a time, rather than simply having AI generate a whole page for you.

You may _not_ simply have AI do the entire project: you should be guiding the computer to help you make your own vision come to life, and you should be using your own eye as a designer
to make sure the final product is something you are proud of.

## Required Components

### HTML Elements

Your project must include:

- A single webpage (index.html)
- At least one semantic heading (h1 or h2)
- Proper use of paragraphs (p)
- At least one image (img)
- At least one list (ul or ol)
- A citations page, which lists all sources for images, icons, fonts, and information used in your project (can be a separate HTML page or a section at the bottom of your main page) and includes a detailed description of how you created the project (tools, resources, process, including thorough and honest citation of AI use).

### Design Requirements

Your website must be:

- visually coherent and thematically consistent
- easy to navigate
- designed with clear affordances (users should know what’s clickable)

### JavaScript Interactivity

Your page must respond to user actions. Include all three:

1. A reveal or hide interaction  
   (showing a detail panel, toggling text, expanding a card)

2. A content-swap or visible state change  
   (switching which section or mode is shown)

3. A visual indicator of progress, choice, or state  
   (wheel rotation, highlighted selection, progress bar, etc.)

## Honors Components (optional)

For Honors students, include at least two of the following:

- A custom hover or transition animation
- An embedded multimedia element (audio or video)
- Social sharing meta tags (Open Graph)
- A more complex JavaScript interaction (multi-step logic, advanced class toggling)

---

## Project Ideas

Your interactive explainer could be about:

- a hobby or passion (music genres, sneaker types, crochet tools)
- a guide (“Which Snack Should I Eat Right Now?”)
- a mood tracker (“The Four Moods of the Day”)
- a science explainer (“Why Leaves Change Color”)
- a decision helper (“Which Study Technique Should I Use?”)
- a personal wheel (“Which Version of Me Are You Talking To?”)

Pick something fun or meaningful — the better the fit, the better the design.

## Grading

You will receive **two grades**.

### 1. Published Website (Design & Function)

Evaluated using a version of the Digital Content Creation rubric, focusing on:

- Content clarity and engagement
- Interactivity (does it work? does it feel natural?)
- Visual design (coherence, readability, consistency)
- Correctness (clean structure, valid HTML/CSS)
- Usability (intuitive, smooth navigation)
- Honors additions (if applicable)

### 2. In-Class Write-Up (Understanding & Reflection)

You will answer questions that demonstrate your understanding of:

- your HTML structure
- how your JavaScript handles interactivity
- your design choices (typography, color, layout)
- how you used classes, selectors, and IDs
- (Honors) your multimedia and social meta tag choices

## Resources

- HTML & CSS Basics
- JavaScript DOM fundamentals (querySelector, event listeners, classList)
- W3Schools Reference
- HTML Validator: https://validator.w3.org/nu/
- Sandbox Overview (linked above)

## Summary

This project blends **graphic design**, **user experience**, and **JavaScript interactivity** into one interactive, single-page explainer. You’ll build a website that teaches, guides, or advises the user while expressing your own personality and visual style.

Your goal is to make something that doesn’t just move — but something that moves the user _through_ an idea.

Make it fun.  
Make it yours.  
Make it interactive.
