## Task

Create an interactive, single-page website that teaches the user something through design and interactivity. You’ll build a small “explainer” experience where users choose reasons, explore states, or navigate through a concept — and the page responds with movement, reveals, and visual changes.

Think of it as a mix of:  
- an infographic  
- a guided decision tree  
- a playful interface demo  
- a tiny storytelling experience

Your teacher’s demo will be a site called “Should I Ride?”, but your topic will be completely your own.

## Why This Project?

Modern web design is rarely static. Designers build experiences where visuals change, cards reveal information, and users “poke” the interface to learn more. Even simple JavaScript can transform layout into behavior.

This project helps you explore:
- how to present information visually  
- how to guide users through a story or decision  
- how interactivity can clarify (or complicate!) a design  
- how user actions change what they see  

No frameworks. No libraries. Just HTML, CSS, and a bit of vanilla JavaScript.

## A Note on AI

Generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT or Claude) can be useful for small tasks, but they often produce generic layouts and lifeless writing.

**DO NOT** use AI to generate full webpages or complete designs.  
This is considered cheating.

You *may* use AI for small elements such as:
- refining a paragraph  
- suggesting images or lists  
- explaining a JavaScript error  
- brainstorming visual ideas  

If AI generates any specific content (text, lists, images, long paragraphs), you must include a comment in your code crediting it.

Example (comment only):
AI-generated content: list of climbing holds created using ChatGPT

Note: If you use the AI within Codespaces, I have provided a guide to it under ~/.github/copilot-instructions.md  If you want to use another AI to help, I recommend including the prompt 
I provide under AI.md as a prompt to help it help you.

## Required Components

### HTML Elements
Your project must include:
- A single webpage (index.html)
- At least one semantic heading (h1 or h2)
- Proper use of paragraphs (p)
- At least one image (img)
- At least one list (ul or ol)

### Design Requirements
Your website must be:
- visually coherent and thematically consistent
- easy to navigate
- designed with clear affordances (users should know what’s clickable)

### JavaScript Interactivity
Your page must respond to user actions. Include all three:

1. A reveal or hide interaction  
   (showing a detail panel, toggling text, expanding a card)

2. A content-swap or visible state change  
   (switching which section or mode is shown)

3. A visual indicator of progress, choice, or state  
   (wheel rotation, highlighted selection, progress bar, etc.)

You may use the rotating-wheel model from the teacher demo, or create your own pattern.

---

## Honors Components (optional)

For Honors students, include at least two of the following:
- A custom hover or transition animation
- An embedded multimedia element (audio or video)
- Social sharing meta tags (Open Graph)
- A more complex JavaScript interaction (multi-step logic, advanced class toggling)

---

## Project Ideas

Your interactive explainer could be about:
- a hobby or passion (music genres, sneaker types, crochet tools)
- a guide (“Which Snack Should I Eat Right Now?”)
- a mood tracker (“The Four Moods of the Day”)
- a science explainer (“Why Leaves Change Color”)
- a decision helper (“Which Study Technique Should I Use?”)
- a personal wheel (“Which Version of Me Are You Talking To?”)

Pick something fun or meaningful — the better the fit, the better the design.

## Grading

You will receive **two grades**.

### 1. Published Website (Design & Function)
Evaluated using a version of the Digital Content Creation rubric, focusing on:
- Content clarity and engagement
- Interactivity (does it work? does it feel natural?)
- Visual design (coherence, readability, consistency)
- Correctness (clean structure, valid HTML/CSS)
- Usability (intuitive, smooth navigation)
- Honors additions (if applicable)

### 2. In-Class Write-Up (Understanding & Reflection)
You will answer questions that demonstrate your understanding of:
- your HTML structure
- how your JavaScript handles interactivity
- your design choices (typography, color, layout)
- how you used classes, selectors, and IDs
- (Honors) your multimedia and social meta tag choices

## Summary

This project blends **graphic design**, **user experience**, and **JavaScript interactivity** into one interactive, single-page explainer. You’ll build a website that teaches, guides, or advises the user while expressing your own personality and visual style.

Your goal is to make something that doesn’t just move — but something that moves the user *through* an idea.

Make it fun.  
Make it yours.  
Make it interactive.
